  <p><b><i>Iceland</i></b> is a country of sharp contrast. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic;">Northern Lights in Iceland</p>
  <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. from
    September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for the magnificent lightshow.
    The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun 
    interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic;"> Ice Climbing & Hiking on Glaciers</p>
    <p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake--namly, its 4,500 square miles of glacier.
       Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south
       of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavík (and `Skaftafell).
